 * Given two arrays of integers A and B describing a pair of (A[i], B[i]) coordinates in a 2D plane. 
 * A[i] describe x coordinates of the ith point in the 2D plane, whereas B[i] describes the y-coordinate of the ith point in the 2D plane.
 * Find and return the maximum number of points that lie on the same line.
